# Social Network API

## Description
This is a RESTful API built for a social network platform, designed to allow users to create profiles, post thoughts, react to posts, and form friendships. The backend is built using **Node.js** with **Express.js** for handling routes and **MongoDB** for data storage. This API offers endpoints for user management, creating and managing thoughts, and interactions through reactions and friendships.

### Key Features:
- **User Management**: Users can create, update, and delete their profiles.
- **Thoughts**: Users can create and delete posts (referred to as "thoughts").
- **Reactions**: Users can add reactions to thoughts, enabling interaction and engagement.
- **Friendships**: Users can send and accept friend requests, manage their friend list, and interact with friends.

This API is designed to be flexible and scalable for future enhancements, including additional features like message boards or notifications.
